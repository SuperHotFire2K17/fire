<h1>The Life of a Hitta!!!!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Facts about me...
<p>D.O.B- January 16,1999.
</p>I have 6 total siblings which includes 4 brothers and 2 sisters.
</p>I am currently employed at the Food Lion on Colley Ave, and I have been working there for almost 2 years.
</p>I am also a senior at Norview High School, and I am set to graduate on June 12 at 1 o'clock inside the Ted Constant Center.  

<h3>Background
</p>My name is Adrian DeCastro, and I from Norfolk, Virginia. I recently turned 18 four months ago and will be graduating in a months time. After i finish high school I plan on becoming a Merchant Seaman. I choose to do this because they pay well and going back to school right after high is not what i think is best for me. In my spare time i am spending my time with my family.
